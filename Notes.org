* Goals
** Define a function and call it
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (defn square (n)
       (* n n))

     (println (square 2))
   #+END_SRC
* Observations   
** Not being able to print random data is super annoying
*** I wanted to check that my tokenize fn is working and the best I can do is check the length
** It seemed good to flatten the expression type
*** Originally had ~type atom = Symbol | Number;~ too
*** It's a bit annoying that you can't have types without constructors
*** Like expression needs list wrapped in List
** Can use a repl to see return values?

**** It sucks
*** the ocaml binary sucks too
** Emacs editor support is pretty bad
